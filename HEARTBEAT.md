## Active — Extensions to Build (priority order)

- [x] BUILD: `agent-kanban` extension — DONE 2026-04-03. Full 4-column board, drag-drop, Start dispatches to peers, actions API, detail panel, modal, status badges
- [x] BUILD: `local-models` extension — DONE 2026-04-03. 20 curated GGUF models in size groups, probes Ollama/llama.cpp/LM Studio, manual add, setModel action
- [x] BUILD: `token-counter` extension — DONE 2026-04-03. Live stats, cost table across 5 models, context window bar, countText action
- [x] BUILD: `model-hub` extension — DONE 2026-04-03. HF API search + 15 task filters + sort (downloads/likes/trending/updated). Cards show task badge, dl/likes stats, relative date. "Use" sets ctx:model-hub:selected + invokes setModel on connected peers. "View on HF" opens model page.
- [x] BUILD: `rag-docs` extension — DONE 2026-04-03. File upload (click/drag-drop), configurable chunking (size + overlap sliders), chunk preview with overlap highlighting, keyword search fallback + ext.invoke semantic search, result highlighting, ctx:rag:selected-chunk context producer, state persisted via tile.setState.
- [x] BUILD: `api-proxy` extension — DONE 2026-04-03. Port config, enable toggle, API key field + generator, host allowlist with add/remove, live status polling via ext.invoke('getStatus'), active connection list, stat badges, Copy URL button. ctx:api-proxy:config context producer. configure/getUrl actions.
- [x] CORE: Local API server — DONE 2026-04-03. `src/main/ipc/localProxy.ts` — HTTP server on configurable port (default 1337), Anthropic `/v1/messages` → OpenAI/Ollama format transform, auto-probes Ollama:11434 / LM Studio:1234 / llama.cpp:8080, streaming SSE transform, IPC: localProxy:start/stop/getStatus/probeBackends. Wired into main/index.ts + preload bridge. api-proxy extension upgraded to power tier with main.js that caches live stats via event bus.
- [x] CORE: Claude Code endpoint remapping — DONE 2026-04-03. Added `localProxyEnabled: boolean` + `localProxyPort: number` to AppSettings (shared/types.ts). In terminal:create isClaude branch, calls readSettingsSync() and sets ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:{port}/v1 when enabled. Zero-risk: off by default, no new IPC, purely additive.

## Maintenance

- [x] Verify the Chrome cookie sync works end-to-end — DONE 2026-04-03. Timing is correct (cookies injected before DOM attachment). Found decryption bug: `cookies.ts:13` uses `Buffer.alloc(16, 0)` (null bytes) as AES IV but Chromium macOS uses 16 space chars (`0x20`). This silently breaks all v10 cookie decryption — fix: `Buffer.alloc(16, 0x20)`.
- [x] FIX: Chrome cookie AES IV bug — DONE 2026-04-03. `cookies.ts:13` `Buffer.alloc(16, 0)` → `Buffer.alloc(16, 0x20)`. Chrome sync should now actually inject cookies.
- [x] The extension harness `server.mjs` needs a `package.json` — DONE 2026-04-03. Added `examples/extensions/_harness/package.json` with `npm start` / `npm run dev` scripts
- [x] Review `src/main/ipc/` for any handlers that are registered but never called from preload — DONE 2026-04-03. Found 5 orphaned handlers: `bus:unsubscribe`, `ext:install-vsix`, `fs:basename`, `fs:delete`, `fs:rename`. Also found `window.api.extensions.installVsix` at App.tsx:3097 — runtime TypeError (bridge is `window.electron` not `window.api`). Safe to remove all 5 handlers + fix App.tsx call site.
- [x] Check whether `examples/extensions/artifact-builder/` has an up-to-date `extension.json` — DONE 2026-04-03. Structure is correct. Minor: default model is `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4`, current latest is `claude-sonnet-4-6` — low priority, user-overridable

## Ideas / Future
- [x] Security hook false positives — INVESTIGATED 2026-04-03. Root cause identified (see MEMORY.md). Fix: add `examples/extensions/` auto-approve to `~/.claude/fieldtheory-read-permission-hook.py`. Not done — modifying global user hook needs explicit approval.
- [ ] FIX: Add `examples/extensions/*` to auto-approve in `~/.claude/fieldtheory-read-permission-hook.py` (lines 23–46, same pattern as fieldtheory-mac and .cursor/commands auto-approves). Safe, targeted, one-line fix.
- [x] Add a `validate-extension` command that checks extension.json against the schema and tests that tile HTML loads in the harness — DONE 2026-04-22. Added `scripts/validate-extension.mjs` + `npm run validate-extension`; it validates manifest structure, referenced files, and harness-served tile entry URLs.
- [x] MCP agent-native gap — DONE 2026-04-03. `src/main/mcp-server.ts`: (1) `canvas_create_tile` type widened from hardcoded enum to open string with description listing core types + `ext:<id>` syntax. (2) Added `list_extensions` tool returning id/name/description/enabled/tileTypes/actions/context for every installed extension. Agents can now discover and create extension tiles.
- [ ] Consider a `CHANGELOG.md` — the codebase moves fast and there's no record of what changed when
- [x] agent-kanban v2 — DONE 2026-04-03. Full Cline kanban port: dependency blocking, git worktrees per task, agent session state machine, 5-agent catalog (claude/codex/gemini/cline/opencode), live output streaming, detail panel, input field. 585-line main.js + full board tile HTML.
- [x] Local proxy server complete. End-to-end chain: Claude Code → ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL → localProxy HTTP → format transform → Ollama/LM Studio/llama.cpp → transform back → Claude Code.
- [ ] Kanban sidebar agent: dedicated chat agent that can only manage kanban tasks (no code changes), uses actions API

## Done

- [x] FIX: Chat memory guard is now much more aggressive, and repeated WebContents destroyed listeners no longer stack up — DONE 2026-04-12. `src/renderer/src/components/ChatTile.tsx` now compacts older finished chat messages by dropping rich interleaved layout data, trimming tool/thinking payloads, lowering render/live caps, and flattening old blocks back to simpler text for memory safety. `src/main/ipc/bus.ts`, `src/main/ipc/terminal.ts`, and `src/main/ipc/fs.ts` now attach only one destroyed cleanup listener per renderer `WebContents`, fixing the earlier `MaxListenersExceededWarning` pattern.

- [x] FIX: Discovery edges no longer stack directly on top of each other, and locked edges suppress same-pair proximity edges — DONE 2026-04-11. `src/renderer/src/App.tsx` now assigns lane offsets to identical ambient routes and gives locked connections precedence so only the locked route remains for that pair.

- [x] FIX: Dragging images, videos, PDFs, and docs onto the canvas now creates sensible blocks — DONE 2026-04-11. `src/renderer/src/App.tsx` now classifies local media/docs into `image`, `browser`, or `file` instead of dropping unknown files into terminals, and the missing `file` render path is now wired up.

- [x] FIX: Chat runtime cache now disposes cleanly on close and debounces persistence — DONE 2026-04-11. `src/renderer/src/components/ChatTile.tsx` no longer writes full tile state on every streaming token, and closing a chat block now disposes its in-memory runtime snapshot instead of letting unmount persistence recreate deleted state.

- [x] FIX: Tabbed view no longer drops live chat state on remount — DONE 2026-04-11. `ChatTile` now restores from an in-memory per-tile runtime snapshot before disk and flushes its latest snapshot on unmount, including streaming state; `PanelLayout` also stops keeping every inactive lightweight tab mounted.

- [x] FIX: Chat `@` autocomplete now prefers connected file tiles — DONE 2026-04-11. `src/renderer/src/components/ChatTile.tsx` now lists connected file-backed peers before generic mention stubs, and choosing one auto-attaches that file so the outgoing message includes its path block.

- [x] FIX: Previous sessions hidden behind alias workspace ids — DONE 2026-04-11. `src/main/ipc/canvas.ts` now reads/writes/migrates tile and canvas state across all workspace ids that share the same `workspace.path`, so `createWithPath(...)` aliases can see older sessions instead of acting like fresh workspaces.
- [x] FIX: Sticky-note link pills and font controls — DONE 2026-04-11. Connection/link pills now render under tiles instead of above them, and sticky notes now have a titlebar font picker with persisted note-friendly fonts.
- [x] FIX: GitHub release workflow hardened — DONE 2026-04-11. `.github/workflows/release-on-tag.yml` still auto-runs on `v*.*.*` tag pushes, and now also supports manual rerun against an existing tag with explicit ref checkout and release-specific concurrency.
- [x] FIX: Session sidebar now aggregates external agent histories — DONE 2026-04-11. The sessions list now merges local CodeSurf chat tiles with `.codesurf/sessions`, Claude transcripts, Codex sessions, Cursor chats, OpenClaw session indexes, and OpenCode conversation files, with source-specific icons.
- [x] FIX: macOS traffic lights now track sidebar collapse — DONE 2026-04-11. `src/main/index.ts` now repositions native traffic lights via IPC when the renderer toggles the sidebar, so collapsed and expanded layouts can use different x offsets.
- [x] FIX: OpenCode model list now loads in the background — DONE 2026-04-11. `chat:opencodeModels` returns cached/fallback models immediately and refreshes asynchronously, broadcasting `chat:opencodeModelsUpdated` so ChatTile updates without blocking the UI.
- [x] FIX: OpenClaw chat provider CLI invocation was broken — DONE 2026-04-10. `src/main/ipc/chat.ts` and `src/main/relay/provider-executor.ts` now call the real `openclaw agent --json --message ...` interface with `--agent`/`--session-id` instead of nonexistent flags like `--output-format`, `--approval-mode`, `--model`, and `-p`. Note: OpenClaw routes by configured agent, not a per-turn model flag.
- [x] FIX: Hermes chat provider CLI invocation was broken — DONE 2026-04-10. `src/main/ipc/chat.ts` and `src/main/relay/provider-executor.ts` now call `hermes chat --query ... --quiet --source tool` instead of the invalid top-level `hermes -q ... --compact` form; also captures `session_id:` output correctly.
- [x] FIX: Legacy home-directory migration crashed on symlinked extensions — DONE 2026-04-10. `src/main/migration.ts` now preserves symlinks during `~/.contex -> ~/.codesurf` merge instead of calling `copyFile()` on entries like `extensions/agent-kanban`, which caused startup `ENOTSUP` failures.
